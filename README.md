### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Â Crafting code like a wizard.
Currently working as a Full Stack Developer, I have always been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities. Three years ago, I decided to turn my passion for coding into a career and since then, I have never looked back.
I'm currently learning Spline and experimenting with Python, constantly adding new skills to my toolkit. However, my heart lies in front-end development and the magic of creating visually stunning interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly.
As a Full Stack Developer, I have been fortunate enough to work with a variety of technologies such as NodeJS, Flutter, React, React Native, Dart, NestJs, and NextJS. But out of all these, NodeJS holds a special place in my heart as it has given me the superpowers to build scalable and efficient web applications.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me to push my limits and constantly learn new things. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
