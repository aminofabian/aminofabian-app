Currently working as a Full Stack Developer, I have always been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities. Three years ago, I decided to turn my passion for coding into a career, and since then, I have never looked back.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me to push my limits and constantly learn new things. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.

🤔 I’m looking for help with Spline and Python  
💬 Ask me about front-end development, Node.js, or any of the other technologies I am proficient in!
