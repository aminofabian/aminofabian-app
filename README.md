<p>👨‍💻 Crafting code like a wizard. Currently working as a Full Stack Developer 🖥️, I have always been fascinated by technology 💡 and its endless possibilities. Three years ago, I decided to turn my passion for coding into a career 👔 and since then, I have never looked back.</p> 
<p>I'm currently learning Spline 📚 and experimenting with Python 🐍, constantly adding new skills to my toolkit 🧰. However, my heart ❤️ lies in front-end development and the magic ✨ of creating visually stunning interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly.</p> 
<p>As a Full Stack Developer, I have been fortunate enough to work with a variety of technologies such as:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>NodeJS 🚀</li>
    <li>Flutter 🦋</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>React Native</li>
    <li>Dart</li>
    <li>NestJs</li>
    <li>NextJS</li>
</ul>
<p>But out of all these, NodeJS holds a special place in my heart as it has given me the superpowers 🦸‍♂️ to build scalable and efficient web applications.</p> 
<p>I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge me to push my limits 💪 and constantly learn new things. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning 🎓 and staying updated with the latest industry trends 📈.</p>
